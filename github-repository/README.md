To install, change BradleyA to your Github repository owner name or who you signed in as on Github. Use git to pull or clone these scripts into the directory. If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git". On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.

    cd /tmp
    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/Linux-admin
    cd Linux-admin/github-repository
    ./setup.github.repository.sh BradleyA

### FILE Definition and ARCHITECTURE TREE

    machine api.github.com login BradleyA password secret-not-known-to-you

#### System OS script tested
 * Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

 * Be usable as non-root - failed adminstration requires root
 * Be easy to install and configure
