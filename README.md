 ## Clone
 
 To install, change directory to the location you want to download the scripts. Use git to pull or clone these scripts into the directory. If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git". On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.
 
     git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/Linux-admin
     cd Linux-admin

 #### System OS script tested
  * Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (amd64,armv7l)
  * Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (armv7l)
 
 #### Design Principles
  * Have a simple setup process and a minimal learning curve
  * Be usable as non-root - failed adminstration requires root
  * Be easy to install and configure
